# E-Commerce PoC Application

This project is a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** for a shopping application similar to **Flipkart**. It showcases essential features such as user authentication, product listing, product creation, and search functionality, all built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

The app is designed with a focus on a seamless user experience, fast performance, and a modular, maintainable codebase.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Handles user login and logout functionality for secure access.
- **Product Listing**: Displays products dynamically with pagination or infinite scroll.
- **Create Products**: Allows admins to add new products to the catalog.
- **Product Search**: Users can search for products based on various criteria.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implements Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast development and real-time updates.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, making the code more predictable, safer, and easier to maintain.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that provides a fast and optimized development experience.
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis tool to identify and fix problems in the codebase.
- **Babel/SWC**: Used for fast refresh (HMR) in development to improve the developer experience.
